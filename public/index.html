<h2>Computers and Me</h2>

<p> I am Anand and I live in US. I have been in Computer industry since 1993 and have worked in many software development projects (embedded, Telecom, routing protocol development, middleware, Sysadmin). I started with C and moved on to use C++ during late 90s and fell in love with scripting languages (Unix Shell, Perl) and used them as productivity tools in all my projects.  </p>

<p> I started exploring Python in early 2000 and got introduced to Ruby from one of my collegue in 2005. I rediscovered the joy of Object Oriented programming by playing around with Ruby and developed productivity tools for self use.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>When I am not programming, I love to play pingpong, watch Cricket and listen to Music (Indian classical, Soft Rock) </p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>
<p>I am reachable at bapata@ymail.com </p>
